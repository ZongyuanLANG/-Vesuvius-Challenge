In the code folder contains all the code used for this assignment.
In the result_images folder contains all the images that are predicted by our models.

FCN：
To train the FCN model, find and run the FCN.py file inside the FCN folder. The output image after running will be saved in the FCN-Figure folder.
environment: python version: 3.8
             tensorflow: 2.10
			 
Unet++ and Deeplab3:
To train Unet++ and Deeplab3, you should run train.py. The following plots are stored in folder Unet++ and Deeplabv3. The model.py contains the definition of the networks.
